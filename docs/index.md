    <h2>SSL/TLS Traffic Analysis Made Simple</h2>
    <p><strong>Real-time key extraction and traffic decryption for security research</strong></p>
</div>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install friTap
pip install fritap

# Basic usage - Desktop application
sudo fritap --pcap capture.pcap firefox

# Mobile application analysis
fritap -m -k keys.log com.example.app
```

## What is friTap?

friTap is a powerful cybersecurity research tool that simplifies SSL/TLS traffic analysis by automating key extraction and traffic decryption. Built on the Frida dynamic instrumentation framework, friTap enables security researchers to analyze encrypted network communications in real-time across multiple platforms.

### Key Capabilities

- **🔑 Real-time Key Extraction**: Automatically extract TLS keys as they're generated
- **📊 Live Traffic Decryption**: Decrypt and save TLS payload as PCAP files
- **🌐 Multi-Platform Support**: Works on Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS
- **🔧 Extensive Library Support**: Supports OpenSSL, BoringSSL, NSS, GnuTLS, WolfSSL, and more
- **🚀 Pattern-Based Hooking**: Hook stripped libraries without symbols
- **🔍 Advanced Analysis**: Bypass anti-analysis techniques and SSL pinning

### Use Cases

- **Malware Analysis**: Decrypt C&C communications and data exfiltration
- **Privacy Research**: Analyze application data transmission practices
- **Security Testing**: Validate SSL/TLS implementations and configurations
- **Digital Forensics**: Recover encrypted network communications
- **Application Analysis**: Understand how applications handle secure communications

## How It Works

friTap uses dynamic instrumentation to intercept SSL/TLS operations at the library level:

1. **Library Detection**: Automatically identifies the SSL/TLS library used by the target application
2. **Hook Injection**: Dynamically hooks key functions (read, write, key generation)
3. **Data Extraction**: Captures plaintext data and encryption keys in real-time
4. **Output Generation**: Saves results as PCAP files or key logs for analysis

    # Capture Firefox traffic
    sudo fritap --pcap firefox_traffic.pcap firefox
    
    # Extract keys from Thunderbird
    sudo fritap -k thunderbird_keys.log thunderbird
    ```

=== "Android Application"
    ```bash
    # Analyze mobile app with key extraction
    fritap -m -k keys.log com.example.app
    
    # Full packet capture with decryption
    fritap -m --pcap decrypted.pcap com.example.app
    ```

=== "Pattern-Based Hooking"
    ```bash
    # Hook libraries without symbols
